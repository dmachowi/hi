#Programming Background
**I haven't had a lot of programming experience, I took a Visual Basic class and half a C++ class in high school. During the summer I took CS 165 so I feel comfortable with C++**

*I enjoyed CS 165. I made a game for the final project which I liked a lot, but there were some weird things I had to put in to get all the reqs in*

#More me info
*I'm from Crown Point, Indiana which is just over the border from Chicago. I went to Indiana Univeristy where I majored in Chinese, Arabic, French and Linguistics, and minored in Spanish and West European Studies. I then moved to Taipei, Taiwan where I lived for about 4 years teaching English. Then I moved to Rome, Italy.*

##Other info about me
**I have two cats, one is Kenny and he is from Taiwan. I saved him from some jerk who was gonna leave him with the vet to die. I brought him to Italy with me and I got another cat named Lana. Someone left her in a cage outside of a cat rescue place in the middle of the night. **
